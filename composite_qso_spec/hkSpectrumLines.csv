# Line list for spectra of active galaxies
# The following is a list of prominent emission and absorption lines which may be detected in the spectra of quasars. Note the use of paired [ ] and single ] square brackets to denote forbidden lines and semi-forbidden lines respectively.
# Note that lines are usually denoted by the species: i.e. the element and its ionisation state (roman numerals) followed by the wavelength in Angstroms.The exceptions are the hydrogen lines which have particular names: Ha, Hb, Lya etc.
# This line list has been adapted from Table 24.6 of Cox, A.N., (Ed.) 2000, Allen's Astrophysical Quantities (Fourth Edition), Springer-Verlag, New York.  Note that at wavelengths below 2000Å, wavelengths are in vacuo, and above 2000Å wavelengths are in air.
